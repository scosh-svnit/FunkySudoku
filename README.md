# FunkySudoku
This website is a hobby project as a part of the learning and development under SCOSH in-house activities.

## Plan
- We will be making a sudoku solver in fundamental essence.
- Instead of a program script, we will be making a website with minimalistic UI/UX.
- Technologies we will be working on Flask, HTML, CSS, Javascript. :) Simple!

Following are the good first steps before jumping into coding - 
- Fork the repository on your GitHub profile.
- Clone the forked repository from your GitHub profile. Use `git clone`.
- Create new issues or solve the existing ones.
